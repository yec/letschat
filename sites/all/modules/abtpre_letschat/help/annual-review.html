In October each year you will need to conduct an Annual review with your team.  Enter, add and update your Annual review comments for the objectives, development plan and the self-assessment by clicking on the options below.  You will also be able to review any comments added by your team.

The Annual review comments should capture the individuals overall performance at the end of the year and how they achieved against the objectives, measures and development plan.

Once you have both discussed and agreed on the Annual review check ‘approved’. Once approved the employee cannot make changes unless you agree and make it ‘unapproved’.
